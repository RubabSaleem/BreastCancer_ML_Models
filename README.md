# BreastCancer_ML_Models
It is given by Kaggle from UCI Machine Learning Repository, in one of its challenge
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. It is a dataset of Breast Cancer patients with Malignant and Benign tumor.

Logistic Regression is used to predict whether the given patient is having Malignant or Benign tumor based on the attributes in the given dataset.
The Data: Extracted from the UCI ML repository
Attribute Information:

id diagnosis: M = malignant, B = benign Columns 3 to 32

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius: distances from the center to points on the perimeter texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values perimeter area smoothness: local variation in radius lengths compactness: perimeter^2 / area - 1.0 concavity: severity of concave portions of the contour concave points: number of concave portions of the contour symmetry fractal dimension: "coastline approximation" - 1 The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
